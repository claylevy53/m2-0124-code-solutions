## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?

It is taking an array/object and being able to save the content of them to other variables. Also being able to modify and add items to the array/objects.

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?

You first have to use use declaration (let, const) and then use {}, within the brackets you can extract/modify any info of an object any necessary.

You can either just name the variables outright in a 1:1 relation extracting the values of the object. Or you can use the name of the key of the object, such as {keyName: variableName} and store the value in a variable

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?

You first have to use use declaration (let, const) and then use [], within the brackets you can extract/modify any info of an object any necessary

- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?

Primarily by the brackets you must use {} = object, [] = array
