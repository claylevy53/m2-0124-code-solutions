## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are props in React?

In React, "props" is short for properties. Props are a way to pass data from parent components to child components. They are immutable and are used to customize or configure a component when it is created. Props allow you to make your components reusable and modular, as they enable you to pass different data to the same component based on different requirements or contexts.

- How do you declare and access props in a component?

You declare props in a component by specifying them as parameters in the component's function or as arguments in its class constructor. Once declared, you can access props within the component using the props object.

- How do you pass props to a component?

You pass props to a component by specifying them as attributes when you render the component. The values of these attributes are then accessible inside the component via the props object.

- How do you write JavaScript expressions in JSX?

In JSX, you can write JavaScript expressions by wrapping them in curly braces {}. This allows you to embed JavaScript logic or values directly within your JSX code.
