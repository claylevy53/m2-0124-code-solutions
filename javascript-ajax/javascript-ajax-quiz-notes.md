- What event is fired by `XMLHttpRequest` objects when they are finished loading the data from the server?

The event fired by XMLHttpRequest objects when they are finished loading the data from the server is the load event

- **Bonus Question**: An `XMLHttpRequest` object has an `addEventListener()` method just like DOM elements. How is it possible that they both share this functionality?
