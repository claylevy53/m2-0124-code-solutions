## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is an "event" in React?

An "event" in React is an action or occurrence that happens during the interaction with a component, such as a mouse click, keypress, or form submission.

- What is an "event handler"? Which component declares the handler?

An "event handler" is a function that gets executed in response to an event being triggered. The component where the event handler is declared is typically the one where the event occurs.

- How do you pass an event handler to a React component?

You pass an event handler to a React component as a prop, similar to how you pass any other data or function to a component.

- What is the naming convention for event handlers?

React documentation suggests that Event Handlers be named handleXxx, where Xxx is the event it is handling. This is just a convention, but it aids code clarity

- What is an "event handler prop"? Which component declares the prop?

An "event handler prop" is a prop in a React component that represents an event handler function passed down from a parent component. The parent component usually declares this prop.

- What are some custom event handler props a component may wish to define?

Some custom event handler props a component may wish to define include "onCustomClick", "onCustomChange", "onCustomSubmit", etc.

- What is the naming convention for custom event handler props?

The naming convention for custom event handler props follows the same pattern as standard event handlers, i.e., camelCase with the "on" prefix followed by a descriptive name of the custom event.
