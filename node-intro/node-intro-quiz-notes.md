## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the 3 components of a fullstack Web architecture?

Frontend (Client-side): User interface components, typically built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Backend (Server-side): Application logic and data management, often implemented using technologies like Node.js, Python, Ruby on Rails, etc.

Database: Storage and retrieval of data, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.

- What is Node.js and why is it useful?

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side.

It's useful for building scalable, fast, and real-time web applications, as well as for developing APIs and microservices.

Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model makes it well-suited for handling asynchronous operations, such as network requests and file system operations

- What are environment variables and how do you access them in Node.js?

Environment variables are key-value pairs that are accessible to a Node.js application at runtime.

They are used to configure application behavior, manage sensitive information like API keys and database credentials, and maintain consistency across different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).

You access environment variables in Node.js using the process.env object, e.g., const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;.

- What is a REPL?

REPL is an interactive programming environment that allows you to execute code snippets, evaluate expressions, and experiment with language features in real-time.

In Node.js, you can access the REPL environment by typing node in your terminal or command prompt.

It's useful for quickly testing code, debugging, and exploring the behavior of JavaScript constructs.
