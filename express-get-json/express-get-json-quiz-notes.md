## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is an API endpoint?

A API endpoint is a specific route/url on a web server that is used to interact with an API. They represent a point of interaction between different software applications and allow them to interact with each other. Endpoints are typically defined by HTTP methods they support. Each endpoint serves a specific purpose of functionaliy within an API.

- What is the appropriate `Content-Type` header for HTTP messages that contain JSON in their bodies?

The appropriate Content-Type header for HTTP messages that contain JSON in their bodies is application/json. When a client sends an HTTP request with JSON data in the body, it should include the Content-Type: application/json header to indicate to the server that the content being sent is JSON-formatted data. This allows the server to parse the incoming request body correctly.
